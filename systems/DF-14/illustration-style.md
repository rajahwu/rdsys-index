# **5\. Illustration Style**

Style: Clean, modular, cinematic. Emphasis on grid-based composition, subtle gradients, and motion design aesthetics. Technical but polished — more UI mockup than street art.

Palette: Primarily neutral.light (\#F5F5F5) and white (\#FFFFFF) backgrounds with brand.primary (teal) and brand.secondary (red) accents. Use tier colors (gold, lavender, slate) for secondary depth. Subtle gradients allowed for cinematic polish.

Visual Elements:

* Modular grid overlays  
* Animation frame sequences  
* UI screenshots and mockups  
* Abstract frame-based shapes  
* Motion blur hints (speed/progress)  
* Clean geometric compositions

Use Cases:

* Hero backgrounds: Subtle gradients with grid overlays  
* Process diagrams: Modular blocks showing workflow stages  
* Empty states: Clean frame with "build your system" messaging  
* Onboarding: Animation frames showing brand evolution  
* Feature highlights: UI mockups with teal/red accents

Mood/Approach:  
Cinematic clarity meets design systems. Think: polished product shots, clean studio photography, modern motion graphics. Visual reference: Linear app, Stripe dashboard, Apple product pages, motion design studios. Minimal grit, maximum polish.

Photography Guidelines:

* Style: Clean studio shots, process close-ups, UI mockups  
* Subjects: Screens in motion, hands interacting with designs, workspace setups  
* Lighting: Soft, even lighting — avoid harsh shadows  
* Composition: Rule of thirds, generous negative space for text overlays  
* Color treatment: Slight cool tone, preserve teal/red brand colors  
* Do's:  
  * Professional product photography  
  * Motion blur for energy  
  * Clean backgrounds  
  * Grid-aligned compositions  
  * Polished, final-product feel  
* Don'ts:  
  * Gritty textures  
  * Street photography style  
  * Overly saturated colors  
  * Cluttered compositions  
  * Work-in-progress roughness
