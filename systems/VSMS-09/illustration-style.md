# **5\. Illustration Style**

Style: Atmospheric and contemplative. Combines misty mountain photography with subtle ink-wash textures. Minimal detail, maximum mood. Focus on elevation, journey, and calm progress.

Palette: Primarily brand.neutralLight (\#F5F5F5) backgrounds with brand.primary (\#1C2C4B) and brand.secondary (\#A78A55) accents. Subtle gradients allowed for atmospheric effects (rare exception to flat design).

Visual Elements:

* Layered mountain silhouettes (depth through transparency)  
* Ink-wash textures (organic, hand-crafted feel)  
* Subtle mist/fog effects (suggesting elevation and clarity through clouds)  
* Minimal line work — prefer filled shapes with soft edges

Use Cases:

* Phase markers: Each phase represented by mountain elevation level  
* Empty states: Calm mountain vista with "begin your journey" messaging  
* Onboarding: Progressive journey up mountain path  
* Achievement badges: Peak icons with gold accents  
* Background textures: Subtle ink-wash overlays on cards

Mood/Approach:  
Think: Japanese ink paintings meet Scandinavian minimalism. Contemplative, elevated, patient. Visual reference: traditional sumi-e (ink wash painting), minimalist mountain photography, trail maps with topographic subtlety. Illustrations should inspire calm focus and patient progression.

Photography Guidelines:

* When using actual photography: misty mountain landscapes, soft focus, muted color palette  
* Black and white or desaturated preferred  
* Avoid sharp, dramatic peaks — prefer gentle elevation  
* Horizontal orientation for hero sections  
* Human elements rare — if included, small scale against landscape (suggesting humility of the journey)
