Color Notes:  
VSM School's palette evokes elevation and calm mastery. Deep Indigo (brand.primary) provides trustworthy depth without harshness. Warm Gold (brand.secondary) signals achievement and value — used for progress indicators, highlights, and moments of accomplishment. Stone Grey (neutralDark) grounds the design with readable, approachable text. Soft Background (neutralLight) creates breathing space for focused learning. Semantic accents use natural, muted tones rather than bright digital colors — fitting the misty mountain aesthetic.

Color Pairing Rules:

* Primary emphasis: brand.primary on brand.neutralLight  
* Achievement/progress: brand.secondary accents on neutral backgrounds  
* Text hierarchy: brand.primary (headings) \> brand.neutralDark (body) \> neutral.mid (secondary)  
* Success moments: accent.success sparingly, only for genuine completion
