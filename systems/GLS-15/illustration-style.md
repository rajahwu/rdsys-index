# **5\. Illustration Style**

Style: Urban, textured, street-art influenced. Hand-drawn quality with intentional imperfection. Layered compositions with grit and depth. Think: wheat-paste posters, spray-painted stencils, DIY zine aesthetic.

Palette: Primarily grindline.dark (\#2E2E2E) base with vibrant pops of grindline.teal (\#00A6A6), grindline.coral (\#FF5A5F), and grindline.gold (\#FFC857). Textures and grain encouraged.

Visual Elements:

* Hand-drawn line work (intentional roughness)  
* Halftone patterns and textures  
* Layered paper cutout style  
* Spray paint effects (soft edges, overspray)  
* Stencil-style typography integration  
* Urban photography backgrounds (textured walls, concrete, street scenes)

Use Cases:

* Hero sections: Textured backgrounds with bold typography overlays  
* Service cards: Abstract icons with hand-drawn accents  
* Empty states: "Under construction" style graphics with character  
* Onboarding: Comic-style panels showing process  
* Success moments: Gold spray-paint "stamp" effects

Mood/Approach:  
Street-level maker culture meets professional execution. Visual reference: Brooklyn studio spaces, skate culture graphics, independent record labels, urban murals. More humanity and texture than Dropframe's polished cinema aesthetic — shows the work, not just the result.

Photography Guidelines:

* Style: Candid process shots, hands at work, urban environments  
* Subjects: Creators in action, workspaces mid-project, street-level business  
* Lighting: Natural light, golden hour warmth, occasional harsh shadows acceptable  
* Composition: Rule of thirds but not precious — capture energy over perfection  
* Color treatment: Warm grade with slight grain, boost contrast, preserve vibrant accents  
* Do's:  
  * Real work in progress  
  * Authentic urban environments  
  * Hands-on process shots  
  * Textured backgrounds (brick, concrete, wood)  
  * Dynamic angles and movement  
* Don'ts:  
  * Sterile studios  
  * Overly posed corporate shots  
  * Stock imagery  
  * Perfect white backgrounds  
  * Static, lifeless compositions
