## Color Notes

Content Factor's palette is built around the five pipeline stages — each stage owns a distinct, vibrant color that makes progress immediately visible. Build (orange) starts the journey with energy. Capture (cyan) collects raw material. Transform (lime) refines and processes. Publish (blue) delivers results. Measure (pink) closes the loop with analytics. Neutral palette provides clean, modern foundation without competing with pipeline colors.

## Color Pairing Rules

* Pipeline visualization: Use all five stage colors in sequence  
* UI elements: Neutral backgrounds with pipeline color accents  
* Text: text.primary for headings, text.secondary for body  
* Active states: Match the relevant pipeline stage color  
* Progress indicators: Color-coded by current stage
