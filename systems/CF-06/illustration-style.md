# **5\. Illustration Style**

Style: Clean, diagrammatic, dashboard-focused. Emphasizes flow, progress, and systematic organization. Technical but not sterile — modern and approachable.

Palette: Neutral backgrounds (neutral.background, neutral.surface) with vibrant pipeline color accents. Each stage clearly color-coded.

Visual Elements:

* Flow diagrams showing pipeline progression  
* Dashboard panels with metrics and progress bars  
* Modular grid layouts  
* Clean wireframe cards  
* Code snippets with syntax highlighting  
* Progress indicators and stage markers

Use Cases:

* Pipeline visualization: Flow diagrams showing all five stages  
* Dashboard panels: Modular UI showing active content in each stage  
* Empty states: Clean grid with "start your pipeline" messaging  
* Onboarding: Step-by-step pipeline explanation  
* Documentation: Wireframe diagrams showing content flow

Mood/Approach:  
Think: modern dev tools, Notion-style clarity, systematic dashboards. Visual reference: Linear app, Stripe dashboard, Tailwind docs, GitHub project boards. Illustrations should clarify process and celebrate visible progress.

Composition Rules:

* Use strict grid alignment  
* Color-code by pipeline stage consistently  
* Maintain breathing space (minimum 16px padding)  
* Limit visual complexity — clarity over decoration  
* Show progression left-to-right or top-to-bottom
