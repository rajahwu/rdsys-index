# **5\. Illustration Style**

Style: Flat vector with geometric precision. Subtle layering for depth without gradients. Abstract and diagrammatic rather than representational. Focus on clarity and information hierarchy.

Palette: Primarily neutral.50, neutral.100, neutral.900 for structure. brand.primary (\#3B82F6) pops for emphasis. Accent colors (success/warning/error) used semantically, never decoratively.

Line Work: Minimal or absent — prefer filled shapes with clean edges. When lines are needed: 2px weight, rounded caps, matching icon stroke style.

Shapes: Geometric primitives (circles, rectangles, rounded rectangles). Grid-based composition. Consistent corner radii (8px for cards, 4px for smaller elements).

Use Cases:

* Empty states: Simple geometric compositions showing "no data" or "nothing here yet"  
* Onboarding slides: Diagrammatic explanations of token systems, component structure  
* Documentation diagrams: Visual explanations of spacing scales, color hierarchies, type systems  
* Error states: Clear, non-alarming visuals indicating what went wrong

Mood/Approach:  
Professional, systematic, educational. Think design system documentation, not marketing fluff. Illustrations should teach and clarify, not entertain. Visual reference: Figma documentation, Stripe design system, thoughtful technical diagrams.

Composition Rules:

* Use 8px grid alignment  
* Maintain breathing space (minimum 24px padding)  
* Limit colors to 3-4 per illustration  
* Prioritize legibility over aesthetics
